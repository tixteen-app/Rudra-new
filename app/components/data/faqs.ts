    question:
      "What is the minimum and maximum weight of components you can manufacture?",
    answer:
      "We typically handle components ranging from 50 grams to 30 kilograms through the investment casting route, depending on complexity and material.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which materials do you work with?",
    answer:
      "We work primarily with ferrous and non-ferrous alloys, including stainless steels, low alloy steels, carbon steels, and selected non-ferrous grades suitable for air melting. Exotic alloys like cobalt-based or titanium are not handled.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is your typical lead time for prototypes and production orders?",
    answer:
      "Prototypes: 2–4 weeks depending on tooling and material availability\nProduction orders: 4–8 weeks depending on volume and complexity",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle machining in-house?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we offer complete in-house machining capabilities including CNC Turning, VMC, Broaching, Multi-head Drilling, SPM operations, and more.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide surface finishing or post-processing?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we offer several in-house finishing services such as shot blasting, electropolishing, passivation, pickling, buffing, and dye penetrant testing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you carry out quality inspections before dispatch?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Every part goes through multiple Quality Gates (AGNI, VISHWAS, DRISHTI, TEJAS) covering visual inspection, dimensional checks, NDT, and destructive testing where required.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What kind of certifications or quality standards do you follow?",
    answer:
      "We are certified to ISO 9001 and compliant with IATF 16949 standards. We also follow strict PPAP, FMEA, and control plan-based production processes as per customer requirements.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Do you provide First Article Inspection (FAI) or PPAP documentation?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we provide full FAI reports and PPAP Level 3 documentation upon request.",
